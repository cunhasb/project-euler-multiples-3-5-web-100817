# Given an array containing three integers, write a method that returns YES if the three integers are evenly spaced and NO if they are not. The array is not necessarily sorted - do not sort the array before implementing the rest of this method.
# Sample inputs: 1) [4, 6, 2] 2) [1, 3, 6]
# Sample outputs: 1) YES 2) NO
